# Thesis Description Bullets :

- Complexity of deploying and re-configuring distributed systems because of the interaction between all the modules

- Deployment is seen as specific case of reconfiguration in the thesis

- Existing solution generally ensure 2/3 properties [1] ( genericity, parallelism expressivity, separation of concerns)

- The work focus on the execute and knowledge part of (the common loop of autonomic computing (MAPE-K)

- It is possible to reconcile the three properties [1] in one framework / solution

# Research Goal :

- Defining a generic framework for the execution of reconfiguration that reconcile a high level of genericity, Parallelism expressivity and separation of concerns

# Key Contributions :

The thesis have 5 contributions in total, the following 3 are selected as key contributions :

- Madeus : Deployment case 3 properties ensured

- Concerto : extension of Madeus : Reconfig case 3 properties ensured

- Performance models for the Madeus and Concerto

  

# Thesis Structure :

The thesis contains 7 chapters 5 + intro and conclusion, chapter 2 is a background about distributed systems and how we can model them, the 3rd one is the state of the art of reconfig of distributed systems, chapters 4 and 5 are about the contributions Madeus and Concerto reconfig models and finally the 6th Evaluation of the contributions.
